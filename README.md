# icon-p-rep-infra-specs

Documents outlining the specifications for public representative nodes.  This documentation serves to augment the [existing official](https://www.icondev.io/docs/p-rep) docs to give the community a chance to outline our own plans for node deployment.  As P-Rep candidates, it is on us to take the load off of the ICON devs.  We need to be charting our own course as much as possible.  These docs are for those community efforts as we move towards building best practices without having to wait on the devs to tell us everything we have to do.
